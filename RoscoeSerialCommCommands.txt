M and G Codes issued to Arduino processing board via serial port for ROSCOE:

These are the relevant commands for the Arduino attached board that issues serial commands to the motor
controller and receives and disseminates status reports and ultrasonic sensings. The commands are issued
over the serial port with the relemant M and G codes

Motor:
G5 - Absolute command motor C<Channel> P<motor power -1000 to 1000>
G4  - dwell P or S P[milliseconds] S[seconds] so G4 S1 waits 1 second


On a motor problem the following header is published. The vaues require consulting the manual
<motorfault>
1 [fault code]

Ultrasonics:
There are 2, lower and that in the Parrt head. Lower unit is ardunio attached, upper comes over UDP.
The header is 
<ultrasonic>
1 [value]
M301 P22 - Starts the ultrasonic sensing on port 22, NOTE: Port 22 is currently the ultrasonic lower front port of ROSCOE.
M300 P22 - Pulses the ultrasonic sensing

Battery:
M444 V[voltage*10] - sets the warning threshold for motor batter level to the 'V' value, REMEMBER, TIMES 10!
when the message starts publisheng, the battery has fallen below the preset level and the following message occurs:
<battery>
1 [voltage]

EEPROM:
M500 Store settings in EEPROM
M501 Read settings from EEPROM
M502 Revert to default settings
M503 print settings currently in memory

Status:
M700 - retrieve general status - avail mem, etc.
M798 - motor control status
<motorcontrol>
1 [voltage]
2 [amps]
3 [fault]
4 [status]
5 [counter brushless 1]
6 [counter brushless 2]
7 [brushless speed 1]
8 [brushless speed 2]

Control:
M799 - Command Emergency stop
M802 - Acquire analog pin data M802 Pnn Sxxx Mxxx P=Pin number, S=number readings, M=microseconds per reading
<analogpin>
1 [value]
M115 - Firmware rev
M85 S[seconds] - set max inactive time
M45 - Analog write pin - set up PWM P[pin] S[analog val] T[timer mode 0-3] R[resolution 8,9,10 bits] X[prescale 0-7]
M42 - Write digital pin P<pin> S<val>
M43 P[pin] -Read from digital pin P<pin>
<digitalpin>
1 [value]
M44 P[pin] -Read digital pin with pullup: M44 P[pin]
